=====
Ttype is a simple typing tutor, (or "typing test" or "typing trainer", I
don't mind either).

This started because I wanted a simple typing program to test my ability
with a twiddler chorded keyboard.  I just wanted it to look for words in
the dictionary that conformed to certain characteristics (using only
letters a-h, for example).
